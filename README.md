## About the Project

This project is a modern and responsive weather application built with React. It provides users with current weather conditions, daily forecasts, and hourly predictions for various locations. The goal is to deliver an intuitive and user-friendly interface for checking weather information, **accessible on both mobile devices and web browsers.**

## Features

* **Current Weather Display:** Shows real-time weather conditions for a selected location (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
* **Daily Forecast:** Provides a multi-day weather outlook.
* **Hourly Forecast:** Offers detailed hourly weather predictions.
* **Location Search:** Allows users to search for weather information by city or location.
* **Dynamic UI Updates:** Responds to user input and API data seamlessly.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on a wide range of devices, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors.
* **Intuitive Weather Icons/Animations:** Uses a variety of custom icons/animations (like `clear_sky.png`, `rain.png`, `cat.png`, etc.) to visually represent weather conditions.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A fast build tool for modern web projects.
    * [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
    * JavaScript (ES6+)
    * HTML5
    * CSS3
* **API:**
    * [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) - For fetching weather data. *(Open-Meteo typically does not require an API key for basic usage, but if you're using a specific feature that does, please add a note about it).*
* **Package Manager:**
    * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Kaipi007/react-weather-app.git](https://github.com/Kaipi007/react-weather-app.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-weather-app
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port).

    *(Note: If Open-Meteo requires an API key for the specific features you are using, you would still need to add an instruction here for creating a `.env` file and adding the key. Based on common Open-Meteo usage, it's often not required for basic forecasts.)*

## Project Structure

This project follows a standard React application structure, organized for modularity and maintainability.
