## About the Project

This project is a modern and responsive weather application built with React. It provides users with current weather conditions, daily forecasts, and hourly predictions for various locations. The goal is to deliver an intuitive and user-friendly interface for checking weather information, **accessible on both mobile devices and web browsers.**

## Features

* **Current Weather Display:** Shows real-time weather conditions for a selected location (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
* **Daily Forecast:** Provides a multi-day weather outlook.
* **Hourly Forecast:** Offers detailed hourly weather predictions.
* **Location Search:** Allows users to search for weather information by city or location.
* **Dynamic UI Updates:** Responds to user input and API data seamlessly.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on a wide range of devices, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors.
* **Intuitive Weather Icons/Animations:** Uses a variety of custom icons/animations (like `clear_sky.png`, `rain.png`, `cat.png`, etc.) to visually represent weather conditions.


## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A fast build tool for modern web projects.
    * [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
    * JavaScript (ES6+)
    * HTML5
    * CSS3
* **API:**
    * [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) - For fetching weather data. *(Open-Meteo typically does not require an API key for basic usage).*
* **Package Manager:**
    * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kaipi007/react-weather-app.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-weather-app
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port).

    *(Note: If Open-Meteo requires an API key for the specific features you are using, you would still need to add an instruction here for creating a `.env` file and adding the key. Based on common Open-Meteo usage, it's often not required for basic forecasts.)*

## Project Structure

This project follows a standard React application structure, organized for modularity and maintainability.

You are absolutely correct! I understand that despite my attempts to provide the correct Markdown, the Project Structure in your README.md is still not showing correctly on GitHub, appearing misaligned or broken as in the images you've shared.

This is a very specific and frustrating rendering issue with GitHub's code blocks for ASCII art/text-based diagrams.

The core problem is this:

GitHub's Fixed Width: When GitHub displays text within a code block (like your directory tree), it uses a fixed-width font and tries to fit all characters on a single line within the available screen width.
The Characters Themselves: Your diagram uses characters like â”œâ”€â”€, â””â”€â”€, |, and spaces to create the tree structure. These characters, combined with the file/folder names, make the lines inherently longer than regular text lines.
Invisible Wrapping/Scrolling: If a line becomes too long for the exact width of the display area (which can vary slightly based on browser, screen size, and GitHub's UI elements), GitHub will either:
Visually wrap the line: This breaks the alignment of the | characters and ruins the tree appearance. This is what you're seeing.
Introduce a horizontal scrollbar: This keeps the line intact but forces viewers to scroll horizontally to see the entire line, which isn't ideal for readability.
Even with comments removed or shortened, some lines might still be too long to perfectly fit all possible viewing conditions.

What this means for your README.md:

While the Markdown syntax I'm providing is the correct way to write a text-based tree diagram, I cannot force GitHub's renderer to display it perfectly if the lines are still too wide for its layout in the viewing mode.

Since the previous attempts to shorten comments haven't fully resolved the visual issue for you, here are the final possible approaches to make your Project Structure visually correct on GitHub:

Strictly Minimalist Diagram (Most Likely to Work):

Remove ALL comments from the diagram lines. Only include the file/folder names and the tree characters.
This makes each line as short as possible. You can then add a separate "Folder/File Explanations" section below the diagram to describe what each part does.
Screenshot of the Structure:

The most foolproof way to ensure it looks exactly how you want is to create an image of your desired Project Structure tree (e.g., using a text editor that shows it correctly, or a dedicated tool), and then embed that image in your README.md instead of the text code block. This guarantees consistent visual fidelity.
Let's try the first option (Strictly Minimalist Diagram) now, as it's still text-based and easy to update:

I will provide the complete README.md again, but this time, the Project Structure will have no comments at all within the tree diagram. This is the shortest possible version of each line.
